# Multivariable thinking with tidyverse

## A tidyverse tutotrial used in class

We created this tutorial for use in and introductory statistics course to introduce our students to R and tidyverse.  The course is MA206Y - Introduction to Data Analysis and Statistics.  In the course we use the textbook "Introduction to Statistical Investigations" by Tintle et al.

The tutorial is designed to provide an introduction to R using tidyverse.  It is not necessary for the students to be familiar with base R to use this tutorial.

In the tutorial, students learn to navigate RStudio, read in a `.csv` file, become familiar with `dplyr` verbs and create data visualizations with `ggplot2`.  The `dplyr` verbs covered in the tutorial include `summarise()`, `filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, and `group_by()`.  The students also become familiar using `ggplot2` to create scatter plots and histograms.  They are also provided the code to recreate data visualizations found in the course's textbook.  The data sets from the textbook are available [here](http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/data.html).  Inspiration for the tutorial came from hearing Hadley Wickham speak at the United States Military Academy and from his book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html).

## Statistical Investigation Lab (SIL)

Throughout our course we conduct five SILs. We designed the labs to introduce  our students to using R to conduct a statistical investigation.  Our labs follow the same six steps to a statistical investigation outlined in our course textbook, "Introduction to Statistical Investigations" by Tintle et al.  There are similar exercises throughout the textbook, but they do not have the students using a statistical software to conduct their analysis.

In the folder “Statistical Investigation Labs” are SILs that we assigned to our course in the past.  The SILs generally focus on the following topics;
1.	Using tidyverse to explore data
2.	Replicating a published article’s analysis, often one-proportion
3.	Confidence Intervals using data from pew research polls
4.	Comparison of two proportions or means 
5.	Simple linear regression
